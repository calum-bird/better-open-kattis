# Better Open Kattis
In June 2022, the [Open Kattis](https://open.kattis.com) team released an update to the Open Kattis user interface and design. It looks okay, but there are some problems.

### The Problem Page
On problem pages, you can no longer view instructions at full-width, and are instead limited to half-width with the other side of the screen containing the submission pane.

This extension fixes that, by adding a button to navigate between the instruction pane and submit pane - both of which are now a more comfortable width.
